# e-portal
This is my 3rd semester final project. This portal is for university.
aim to establish an e-portal which would allow the main stakeholders i.e.
Administration and the tenants to cooperate with each other seamlessly via a common platform. 
This would streamline the document processing workflows and reduce the paperwork and 
processing times, saving time itself and saving the environment.
